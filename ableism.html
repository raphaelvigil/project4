				<p>This is a quote from <a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/autistic-people-parents-and-advocates-speak-about-autism-speaks/" target="blank">this artcle</a> about all problems with Autism Speaks, and this quote shows not just how bad Autism Speaks is, but how bad some of their supporters are.</p>
				<p>The mere thought of thinking of banning toys from diffrent people is a horrible thing that should never be done, and it never was, but Toys R Us felt the backlash and, at the time of writing, is about to go bankrupt.</p>

				<p>This pictue is from Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) in <a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org/stoptheshock/" target="blank">one of their more recent artcles</a> about a instion called The Jugde Rotenburg Center (JRC), wich was listed by Autism Speaks as a resource during their walk in Washington D.C. in 2013.</p>
				<p>But what happens here is far from nice, fair, and fun. Here, the empolies have litte to no expence in dealling with people that have disabillaties, so most people tend to be shocked for only talking to much, not getting out of their seat within a certan time span, or saying no. What if you have a friend that has boyfriend/girlfriend that always hit them when they said no, would you you try to help your friend?</p>
				<p>Of course you would, so why don't help these people? Just because they says it's "treatemet" doen't suddenly make it right.</p>
